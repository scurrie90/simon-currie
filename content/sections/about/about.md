Hi! I'm Simon - a neurodivergent software developer, writer, math geek, business owner, chess player, beer consumer, mental health advocate, dog owner I could go on.

While my resume may or may not be typical for someone in my field, the path I took to get here was anything but well walked.

I spent my childhood and teenage years in and out of foster homes. During that journey I experienced homelessness, addiction, poverty, and abject helplessness firsthand. I was witness to unimaginable horrors and still deal with trauma in therapy 20 years later.

I have ADHD and autism, and was diagnosed with both in my early thirties, which meant in addition to the already wildly traumatic upbringing, I was also dealing with a brain for which the world was not designed, and that nobody knew was different. Well... they knew. 

I mention all of this solely because it heavily informs my work - I go to therapy and am not searching for a pity party. But I will write about neurodivergence, depression, anxiety, trauma, and mental health in general probably as much as I do tech, science, philsophy and politics. 

On the software side: I will always work with non-profit clients to find a solution within their budget, including providing discounts. I believe its a fundamental clause of the social contract to give back, especially given where I come from (but academically as well.)
