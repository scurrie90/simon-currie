# About This Site

Version 1.0 of this site uses React and Gatsby for the front-end and GraphQL to serve data.

I originally used the gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal, and it still underlies much of the UI, however I added a fair bit of custom React TSX myself.

Anything I wrote custom I wrote in TypeScript - coming from a C# background, I much prefer the strong typing of TypeScript. 

For hosting, I use GitHub Pages with a GitHub Actions Workflow that triggers a fresh deploy any time a push is made to main - the version on the main branch is by definiton the live version. 

I use feature branches to tinker and then merge in when I'm satisfied.

For DNS and all things Domain, I use CloudShare.

The source code for this website can be found on GitHub.
