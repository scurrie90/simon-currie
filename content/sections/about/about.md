Hi! I'm Simon - a neurodivergent software developer, writer, math geek, business owner, chess player, beer consumer, mental health advocate, dog owner... I could go on.

I've spent the majority of the last 34 years in Vancouver with stints in the Okanagan and Vancouver Island. I reside in Fairview with dog Ari - I've oscillated between here and East Vancouver since 1990! I hold a degree and a half from UBC - Philosophy and Math, as well as a Diploma in Software Systems Development from BCIT.

I recently founded Aritech, an IT Consultancy and general umbrella for all things freelance - mostly on the tech side, but also digital marketing/content and my own writing, lest anyone feel the desire to pay me for it. I also have a 9 - 5 with Fujitsu as a Developer on Petrinex.

Over time, this site will become more blog than portfolio, as my freelance work will be under the Aritech umbrella. It also serves as a place for me to tinker - once aritech-solutions.com launches, I likely will avoid major overhauls. I have no such limitations here. If you are interested in what went in to this site, check the About This Site link in the footer for a non-technical overview, or the github link for the source code.

There will likely be some cross-posting, but as Aritech gets up and running, tech stuff will be posted there, and anything else I feel like writing about will go here. Likewise, as I get my Medium, Dev.To, and other content mediums set up and running, there will be cross posting there as well.

My 9 - 5 is fairly boring government work, but my freelance side is where I get to do interesting stuff while giving back. My clients tend to be individuals, small businesses and non-profits - my path to this point was not tyical: I spent my childhood and teenage years in and out of foster homes and was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism in my 30s, so my work choices are heavily informed by my lived experience. As such, while I will blog about tech and digital marketing and the like, over time that stuff will move to aritech-solutions.com. This will be a place where I write about everything else, ranging from the Canucks to Mental Health Awareness to Neurodivergence to Philosophy and Politics. Mostly I'll probably go on little fun rants.

On the business side: I will always work with non-profit clients to find a solution within their budget, including providing discounts. I believe its a fundamental clause of the social contract to give back, especially given where I come from (but from a theoretical perspective as well.)
