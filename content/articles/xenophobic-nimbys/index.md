# Xenophobic Nimbys are Ruining Vancouver
*This article was originally published in 2017 as part of my work as communications coordinator for David Allison Inc.*

After the announcement of the foreign buyers’ tax, the UDI suggested to the government several ways that the might combat unintended consequences on the housing market and the economy in general. These included a transitional phase-in period for the tax, and, especially, the grandfathering of pre-existing contracts, as well as encouraging supply-side housing initiative. And these were excellent suggestions, it’s a shame that the provincial government didn’t heed them as there have been consequences across our industry – whether they were intended or not remains to be seen.

## Social Impacts

But the economic impacts of the foreign buyers’ tax have been beaten to death, so I want to talk about another impact the foreign buyers’ tax has seemed to have – the social impact. We live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and our diversity is one of the key factors in that beauty, yet since the announcement, I have noticed an outpouring of vitriolic, xenophobic, racist rhetoric in various forums. 

This rhetoric adds nothing to the debate about the tax. All it does is makes us look bad, and frankly, as Vancouverites, we should all be ashamed.

### Missing the Point

Not only does reckless xenophobia add nothing to the debate, it actually makes it harder to have the debate. The issue at hand – a foreign buyers’ tax and the impact that has on the housing market and the economy at large – is obfuscated by the ugliness in the commentary. I would say debate, but there is no debate, the commentary that has gone on with regards to this tax is xenophobic, racist, ugly, and reflects terribly on our city. 

And the economics are irrelevant – anyone who is saying it’s not about race, it’s about economic impact or some such, is trying to hide their own xenophobic outlook. If you’re involved in the real estate market in Vancouver, you’re not going to starve due to a tax – and the influx of foreign investment that brought on the tax made you money. Unless you’re First Nations, we were all immigrants at one point. 

Given that there’s no debate to be had: the rhetoric is vile, racist, garbage and it has nothing to do with the economic impacts of foreign investment or foreign investors’ taxes, we as an industry can’t stand for this rhetoric. I don’t have an immediate fix all other than to say: when you hear it, call people on it. It’s your moral duty.
