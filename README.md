# Simon Currie Portfolio Website 1.0

#### A portfolio/blog website using Gatsby/React/DecapCMS/

This website is live at simon-currie.com. If you like it, clone the repo and feel free to tweak to your needs, I certainly did the same using · [Portfolio Minimal Theme on Github](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal). 

Simple but pretty website, part of going live with Aritech. Part portfolio, part blog.
